My name is Alan Ly I am an electrical engineering graduate from San Francisco State University.
I am interested in coding as a hobby and plan to use github for my own personal projects to 
learn and grow my development skills while sharing with others. I enjoy coding in python and
have some experience with C and C++ for embedded applications.

I like to collaborate with others to develop creative solutions in simplest form to solve worlds problem.
